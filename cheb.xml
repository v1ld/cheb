    <text>Am I seeing things?</text>

  <string id="cheb_1_1_2">
    <text>Hi.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_1_2_0">
    <text>You're fine. Help me, please, uncle... I - I'm not just a toy. I'm an assistant, I'm helping someone and I have to find him. It's Uncle Kolya, he's somewhere in the Zone. Please...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_1_2_1">
    <text>I get it, it's a robot! Interesting contraption.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_1_2_2">
    <text>Who is he?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_1_3_0">
    <text>I knew I'd find someone, hurray! Look, are you a good guy or a bad guy? If you're bad, throw me back where you found me, and if you're good, please help me. Will you help me?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_1_3_1">
    <text>I'll help. What should I do?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_1_4_0">
    <text>Please, do not throw me away! I'll die here if no one helps me and along with me, my friend who needs help!</text>

    <text>Madness.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_1_5_0">
    <text>Uncle Kolya, afraid he would be robbed, hid me there 6 months ago and went away on business. And then he disappeared. More recently, I got slung into the anomaly where you found me during a blowout. We need to find Uncle Kolya, I have to know what happened to him. We'll have to follow in his footsteps and for that I can show you the way.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_1_5_1">
    <text>How will you do that?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_1_6_0">
    <text>I can recognize places, I can feel them. When we get close to the right place, I'll give you a signal. So what do you think? Will you help me, kind Stalker?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_1_6_1">
    <text>Good.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_1_7_0">
    <text>Thank you, you really are a good guy! Do you know what we should do? We should go to a Stalker named Tail and ask him about Uncle Kolya. If you wonder why we should go see him first, it's because he's Uncle Kolya's friend. I've enchanted your PDA so that it now shows roughly where we may find Tail.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_1_7_1">
    <text>Well, that's a useful lead.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_2_1_0">
    <text>Hi master, what did you want?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_2_1_1">
    <text>What are you doing here? Who are you?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_2_1_2">
    <text>Remind me, what should I do?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_2_1_3">
    <text>Do you know something interesting?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_2_1_4">
    <text>I have a problem with your request.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_2_1_5">
    <text>Don't you have to eat?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_2_2_0">
    <text>I don't know who or what I am. Since I'm aware of myself I must be someone, not something. I don't remember where I come from, but I do remember something: the place I first appeared is called "Hospital". Someone must have made a strong wish for me to appear. My friend went there and made a very, very strong wish and then I appeared. But one day my friend fell asleep and someone all big and grown-up came and took me with him. It was Nikolai - Uncle Kolya. He came to this area and hid me near where you found me.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_2_2_1">
    <text>Here's how.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_2_3_1_0">
    <text>We should go to the bar and talk to the Stalker named Tail. He'll tell us about Uncle Kolya and it will be easier to find him.</text>
  </string>
   <string id="cheb_2_3_1_0_1">
    <text>Tail said Uncle Kolya went to a place called City-32. Let's look for this place.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_2_3_1_1">
    <text>Got it.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_2_4_0">
    <text>I can provide advice, I can tell a story, I can even come up with something myself.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_2_4_1">
    <text>Where did you learn all that?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_2_4a_0">
    <text>I've laid in the Zone a long time and read the thoughts of Stalkers passing by. What do you say?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_2_4a_0_guid">
    <text>I've laid in the Zone a long time and read the thoughts of Stalkers passing by. Maybe you need advice?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_2_4a_0_no_talk">
    <text>I've laid in the Zone a long time and read the thoughts of Stalkers passing by. Oh, I wish I had something interesting to tell you, but... I've forgotten. I'll remember it in five minutes.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_2_4a_5_remember">
    <text>Well, remember.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_2_4a_1">
    <text>Give advice.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_2_4a_2">
    <text>Tell a story.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_2_4a_3">
    <text>How long till the next blowout?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_2_4a_4">
    <text>Where can I find a good artifact?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_2_4a_5">
    <text>I don't need anything for now.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_guidance_ok">
    <text>Thanks for the advice.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_guidance_1">
    <text>If you meet an enemy in the Zone, do not rush to shoot - first make sure that they really are your enemy. Some mercenaries, soldiers, or even bandits will sometimes make peace with loners if they need help.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_guidance_2">
    <text>Sometimes in the Zone you'll find old safes, locked with combination locks. It is not always possible to break them open or hack them, but if you do you'll often find interesting stuff. If you encounter such a safe, remember the following.\n1) Their code consists of no more than 4 or 6 digits.\n2) The numbers on the wheel - it's the regular numbers from 0 to 9.\n3)Use logical reasoning to figure out the code.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_guidance_3">
    <text>Some artifacts do not have any properties, either positive or negative. However, many of them are still of very high interest to scientists, so do not rush to sell such "useless" looking artifacts: maybe someone else will pay a lot more for them.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_guidance_4">
    <text>Some artifacts are invisible to the naked eye. You have to extract them using those gizmos - I forget what they're called. They're peculiar in the sense that they are created only in certain places and at varying intervals.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_guidance_5">
    <text>Sometimes, instead of valuable loot you might find a book or manuscript. I advise you to think twice before throwing it away or selling it. Even if it sounds ridiculous, you may find some to whom these things are useful among the Stalkers. They may not mind sharing valuable stuff in return, such as interesting intel.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_guidance_empty">
    <text>I feel something is very wrong.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_busy_0">
    <text>Oh, I wish I had something interesting to tell you, but... I've forgotten. I'll remember it in five minutes.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_busy_1">
    <text>Good.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story_next">
    <text>[...go ahead...]</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story_empty">
    <text>Something made me forget all the stories... Oh, you shouldn't bother.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story1_1">
    <text>Once upon a time two Stalkers went exploring for loot together and stumbled upon a very valuable artifact. They immediately rushed to it, bumping their foreheads in their haste! But there was only one artifact and two friends: they needed a solution. They argued again and again, but could not agree. Thought and thought, but to no avail. The first wanted to sell the artifact and split the money, the other wanted to keep such a precious artifact for himself and repay the other with a part of his own loot.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story1_2">
    <text>They argued all day until someone came by and advised them to talk to Zacharie the Forester, who lived alone in the Hollow. The old man was known to his fellow Stalkers for his wisdom and the fairness of his decisions. The friends went to him. They explained the reason for their dispute and he answered them: "The Zone made you quarrel, She shall reconcile you. Take this thing that you found and put it on the rotten stump just behind my hut."</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story1_3">
    <text>"Cover it with the old bucket that is lying there and wait for three hours, then take a look under the bucket. If the artifact turns blue, the first of you shall have it, and if it turns red, the second." The Stalkers went to Zacharie's garden, found the stump and put the artifact on it, covered the artifact with the bucket, and sat to wait. After waiting one hour, then two, then three, our friend's nerves started to surrender to the pull of the half-a-million ruble artifact! The first of them started to grumble at the second...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story1_4">
    <text>It went on and on and finally the second snapped and soon there they were, yelling at each other - curses and good old Russian obscenities. They both grabbed their knives, then stopped, waiting to see who would be the first to attack. Suddenly, both noticed that a strange smell was coming from the bucket. One of the former friends cautiously raised its edge and both saw that on the stump, instead of their artifact, there was nothing but an ordinary pile of cow dung. Judging by the smell, it was pretty fresh.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story1_5">
    <text>The two Stalkers lost it for a little while but when they finally came to their senses, they immediately rushed to Zacharie. The old man looked at the stump and told them, "It might not be obvious, but that bucket of mine is anomalous. It revealed to you the secret of the artifact! And to think you were ready to get killed for it..." With these words, the Forester spat juicily onto the stump and went into his hut. What happened to our heroes is unknown, but I do know that nobody ever found that artifact again.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story1_ok">
    <text>Interesting.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story2_1">
    <text>Once upon a time an experienced Stalker went looking for loot and didn't return. They waited for him a day, two, and on the third they waited no more... Suddenly on the fourth day he returns and tell everyone: "Guys, I found something - it's unbelievable. Come with me!" A group of six men gathered, well equipped, armed themselves and went with him. A day passes, two - no sign from them, nor hope of one. The other Stalkers started scratching their heads. The ones that went weren't born yesterday, something was clearly not right. </text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story2_2">
    <text>A second group gathered, about a dozen people; Many were armed to the teeth, high-class rounds, detectors - one stalker even had a RPG pinned on his back. They went and... yes, you guessed it - never returned! Their comrades grieved for a long time, even made something akin to a monument to them near the entrance of the bar: a cross with a gasmask and a sign with their names. They had a little wake at the 100Rads as commemoration. The head of "Duty" suddenly became very interested in this matter.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story2_3">
    <text>He wanted to know what kind of power had emerged in the Zone that almost twenty experienced Stalkers couldn't cope with. He gathered his best scouts and ordered them to find the missing Stalkers and if they couldn't, to at least find the cause for their disappearance. These mens were professionals - athletes, commandos, ninjas! They had learned how to survive in the jungle with only a knife in hand even before entering the Zone.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story2_4">
    <text>They weren't afraid of wild beasts nor anomalies and they could deal bare-handed with not just bandits but also mercenaries. The scouts began the search and went the next day to the supposed place where the missing ones had last been seen - a small abandoned plant. As they approached they smelled a strange chemical smell. The commander of the scouts, an experienced man, immediately ordered his soldiers to put on their gas masks. As they crept in, they saw:</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story2_5">
    <text>In the middle of the main building was a large tank. Around it lay the bodies. The scouts counted a total of eighteen, none of whom moved. Suddenly, from behind a corner jumped out, no, tumbled out, a Stalker with an RPG at the ready. Staggering, he blearily studied the entire company for a long time and then finally and with difficulty said:\nAttention! Your papers! Comrade Commander, my report: As of eight o'clock in the evening one hundred and seven liters remain in the main tank - no leaks were found!\nHe then fell asleep, dead drunk.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story2_ok">
    <text>Thank you for the story.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story3_1">
    <text>There was once a Stalker nicknamed "Beetle". He had been given this nickname for, as you guessed, his cunning and caution. But one day our Beetle went and screwed up. How? Very simple. He took an order for a rare artifact, but instead of informing the client when he found it he went to the "100Rads" Bar. Beetle's client was powerful, from beyond the perimeter. "If he's offended," thought Beetle, "better for me not to come back from the Zone!"</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story3_2">
    <text>He thought and thought and decided to cheat his client. And since he was a cunning Stalker, he decided to use his mind. "I will fake my own death to him," thought our Beetle, "and then quietly leave the Zone. I don't personally know the client anyway, so all will be well." But for the accident to seem plausible, witesses were needed. Beetle decided to use one of his friends who owed him money. That friend was called Slavik, and his nickname was Bubble.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story3_3">
    <text>Beetle, after making careful preparations, asked Bubble to come along with him to the "Rostok" factory. They had come to a place unfamiliar to most Stalkers when Beetle, shouting very loudly and waving his arms, fell, or rather jumped, into a prepared and camouflaged pit. At the bottom of the pit lay the fresh corpse of an unlucky Stalker which Beetle had found on the outskirts of the Bar (a bloodsucker had killed the poor soul).</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story3_4">
    <text>The dead man was wearing the exact same suit as Beetle, had been given the same backpack and weapons, and his face was severely disfigured - all artfully done by Beetle. He didn't foresee one thing though: the night before a hungry snork had gotten into the pit, attracted by the carrion smell of the dead body. One can only imagine the horror and surprise of poor hapless Bubble when he saw at the bottom of the pit two Beetles instead of one and even an extra Snork.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story3_5">
    <text>"Help me!" yelled Beetle in the meantime, lashing out at the mutant. "Just don't shoot, I'll climb! Give me your hand and I'll get out of here!" However, Bubble was not the sort to help someone in a hurry. Having realized that Beetle's chances were rather slim he turned and walked away, ignoring the cries from the pit. He owed too much money to beetle, which also played a role in his decision. Meanwhile, with the hungry, growling snork crawling up to him, our schemer, who had dug the pit himself, found himself in the worst position.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story3_6">
    <text>Beetle raised his AK, but it misfired - the fall had filled the barrel with dirt. He barely managed to get out of the pit, our sly dog, but paid a price for his salvation by letting the snork rip up his legs and back. Limping back to the camp, he learned that mercenaries kidnapped Bubble right out of his tent. Apparently, when the client learned Beetle bailed out on the deal he began searching among his acquaintances. Nothing more has been heard of Bubble, while Beetle is now a career Stalker.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story3_ok">
    <text>Well, well...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story4_1">
    <text>Once upon a time a Stalker was walking through the Garbage when he saw a Fracture sitting on the side of the road. In its paw it held an artifact! The Fracture turned the artifact between his claws and then slipped it into his jacket and ran. The Stalker followied him. He ran behind the escaping Fracture who turned out to be quite clever, going around "Springboards", jumping over "Fruit punches", slipping past "Vortexes"! The Stalker carefully stayed on his trail. They ran into a grove where the Fracture jumped and dropped into a burrow under an old stump. The Stalker took his AK and planted the barrel in the hole.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story4_2">
    <text>He wanted to throw a grenade, but did not - it could have broken the artifact. He sat, trying to catch his breath. Suddenly he hears from the hole a faint voice: "Stalker," it says, "do not shoot at me, I desire to live. Let's make a deal instead: I give you the artifact and even show you a place where there are a lot more of them, and you let me go." The Stalker answered the mutant, "It's a deal!", thinking to himself, "I'll take the artifacts and shoot the monster, though I'll cause him no suffering." Everyone knows it's best not to turn your back on a Fracture - strike it dead instead.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story4_3">
    <text>The Fracture climbed out of the hole, beckoned with its claws, and limped off into the bushes, the Stalker after him. They walked a hundred meters and found a clearing with a large stone in the middle of it. The Fracture crawled to the stone and dug into the earth at its base with his paws.  Pulling into the light an old half-rotten backpack, he poured directly on the Stalker's feet about twenty rare artifacts - more than the Stalker usually collected in a week! The Fracture quietly backed away to get back into the forest after dumping his loot in front of the Stalker. But the Stalker was not born yesterday and quickly realized what was happening.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story4_4">
    <text>The Stalker aimed at the Fracture and said, "Show me the remaining caches, if you don't want me to shorten your tail!"  The freak hissed and groaned. It obviously didn't want to part with its findings but the fear was stronger. Leading the Stalker through the forest, they began to empty caches and transfer the contents into the Stalker's backpack. They stuffed the backpack almost to the top, the Stalker having to throw away all his canned food to make place. Then the Fracture said, "There's one cache left, the greatest."</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story4_5">
    <text>The Stalker was delighted and began to imagine how much he would get for his goods and what he would buy with the money. He estimated that it would be enough to buy his dream - a new "Ford". He began dreaming about coming to his hometown not in the stinking train, but in a brand new car, calling out in the courtyard and honking loudly as if waiting for someone. The neighbours lean out of the window to watch and he gets out of the car, stands next to it, lights a cigarette, puts his hand on the hood. A new suit, shoes, black sunglasses...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story4_6">
    <text>His former classmate, Victor, who had laughed on learning he got a job as welder at the plant with his two diplomas, would shut up for once. The Stalker had never seen such a car even at Victor's father's two stores. Now then, the Stalker and the Fracture approached the last place. The Stalker saw among the young pine trees an aircraft fuselage. A big one, with "Maize" painted on it. How it got there we don't know.  There are rumors, however, of some adventurers who tried to fly over the Zone in private planes to take pictures but got lost and disappeared.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story4_7">
    <text>The fuselage was mangled, peeled off at the tail, the wings broken, the cockpit crushed. The Fracture approached it, opened the door and climbed in.  The Stalker had to wait outside, keeping watch so that the cunning one didn't run away. From the wreckage suddenly came a loud hiss and out of it pops a hefty Chimera. The thunderstruck Stalker immediately started fleeing. He ran into the woods, stumbling, going around "Springboards", jumping over "Fruit punches", slipping past "Vortexes"! He barely made it out. He forgot the loot, only remembering it once he'd gotten his breath back at the bar and noticed the backpack isn't there.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story4_8">
    <text>That's the story... but that's not all! Interestingly, we heard another Stalker saw that same Fracture after a week. He saw it sitting, that asshole, at the same old place again! The man quietly put his automatic to his shoulder and was about to take aim when the freak felt something, jumped up and ran away. The Stalker shot once and missed. He approached the spot the Fracture has sat and saw the lost backpack, stuffed full! He looked inside, it had only cans of food... That cunning Fracture has not been seen again.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story4_ok">
    <text>Yeah...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story5_1">
    <text>Once upon a time a stranger came to visit the Zone. What had he forgotten there? It was just his job - to go around the world, to visit the most dangerous places on the planet, and then to describe them. He was a journalist and a traveller, quite a famous one. He had visited Iraq, Afghanisthan, Libya, even the Chechen Republic. He had travelled the wild jungles of the Amazon and the deserts of Africa, contacted the local hostile tribes, won the confidence of these people, and lived among them.  He had described it in books, written articles for magazines such as "National Geographic" and "Science", he had even been on TV.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story5_2">
    <text>And one beautiful day he decided to visit our Zone and see the Stalkers living here, learn what they eat, what they drink, what they do in their spare time, etc. Our foreigner was especially interested in the local folklore. He was a big connoisseur of literature and knowing Russian well, he had read Pushkin, Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy in the original. He decided to collect if possible all the histories, jokes, legends, and simple fairy tales connected to the Zone and its inhabitants. However, being an experienced man in such affairs, he made his excursion to the Chernobyl zone a secret.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story5_3">
    <text>He knew: first, the military would not allow it; second, bandits would prey on him; third, mercenaries would scam him for payment. So he acted simply and reasonably, but with one mistake - making the operation undercover. So the journalist (James was his name) came to our country under another name, having declared at home in England that he was going to investigate the Sahara Bedouin's culture and customs. He had friends who helped him make a deal for a sortie into the Zone.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story5_4">
    <text>They charged him a lot of money for this and thought he was happy. But the tourist wasn't satisfied with the program.  Being a brave man of Albion, he wanted to dive head first into the atmosphere of danger and risk of a Stalker's life. Our James, who didn't go meet African Bedouins, soon regretted his decision, however. It all started right at the Perimeter where his group was shaken down by Major Ovchinin. I know of this major not just from hearsay - he almost beat a kidney off me once in interrogation when I violated a rule in the Cordon.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story5_5">
    <text>The veteran warrior started his usual shake down on our gallant traveller and his escort. All would go well for those that gave all their loot and shut the fuck up. From skilled Stalkers for whom it was not their first time going into the Zone, they took a smaller sum (not too much, but not copecks either). Experienced Stalkers would usually pay the major if it granted them access to the Zone without problems, knowing at the same time they could earn much more in artifacts later with a little luck.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story5_6">
    <text>But the journalist was an indignant lionheart.  He protested, appealed to fairness, military honor, then recalled the European Court of Human Rights...  When the major had finished with him, he had hardly enough strength to limp to camp. Our journalist, he rested a bit in bed to recover. There our veterans tried to heal him and made the foreigner eat things that only made him worse, worse even than from the beating... Cordon's sludge - it'll heal one while making another suffer, I know it myself.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story5_7">
    <text>And so, when our Englishman came back up on his legs, he wanted to reach the Bar that he'd heard in stories was where most Stalkers live. The locals decided to accompany him. But a few kilometers from the camp they were intercepted by bandits. Turns out someone amongst our guys was a rat, who having seen the pricey equipment of the foreigner, the brand of the gear, snitched to the skinheads. Thank God, the bandits were in a good mood and did not begin to play "moose" as they usually do with beginners.  Those repeated beatings would not have been endured by our journalist.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story5_8">
    <text>But still he reached the Bar, empty-handed and, moreover, half-naked - he'd even lost his military suit, a gift from an American general, and with it, memories of quiet days in Afghanistan. At the Bar the people did not recognize him as a celebrity. Stalkers are simple lads, not interested in science and nature, not reading the latest magazines. They accepted our James as a tourist - such a thing is rare in the Zone, but it happens. He was lodged with the others, got his share out of pity. And our Englishman got accepted among the local brotherhood.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story5_9">
    <text>They advised him to get out of the Zone, but he disagreed. He was engaged in his favorite business: recording local tales and the stories of skilled Stalkers. Then another problem happened to him: trigger-happy mercenaries. They, being animals, sometimes practice their shooting on us so as not to lose their skill. A sniper sits someplace and says let's go, that scum, shooting men that return to the bar after exploring. He wounds the first one, usually someone who fell behind. Who starts yelling, blood everywhere. A friend tries to reach him to help - the sniper shoots him in the forehead.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story5_10">
    <text>When the unfortunate man's comrades hesitate, not hastening to get shot, then the ugly beast begins to shoot the wounded man's fingers or ears... A swine, in a word. And so, our journalist gets to see first hand how depraved the mercenary has become. He shoots the journalist in the calves, first right, then left - so that neither leg feels left. At least this way the sniper's bullets aren't whistling near the temples. The poor fellow has stopped shouting, resigned to his fate, when someone from "Duty" uses a smoke grenade and under cover of the smoke screen drags the poor man from out of the firing zone.</text>
  </string>

    <text>Our hero changed a lot after that experience - before, he was always joking, laughing, and now he has become serious, tight-lipped. Some said after the incident he was heard crying softly at night a couple of times. But that's nothing - the foreigner had grown accustomed to a Stalker's life, and so he absorbed it all, conquered his grief, and rejoiced. It was something he really needed in his heart. Some makeshift scribblings had wound up in the Zone; improvised manuscripts with stories about life in the Zone. Some funny, some others terrible, and yet others sad.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story5_12">
    <text>Some former student probably did this, someone that lived through the first anomalies. But the second our James saw these pieces of paper - he began to shake: it was what he needed! For a long time, he made inquiries about the unknown author, tried every way to find him. But he had disappeared apparently, that odd fellow - nobody found any more of his manuscripts on old yellow pages of Soviet paper. James then began to ask all Stalkers to bring him these "books" for collection. However, he's a trader now. That's his fate.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story5_ok">
    <text>Yeah, that's what happens...</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story6_1">
    <text>Among all the benefits available for Stalkers, the one Vintar loved most was money. No one knew exactly what he collected in two years and a half of life in the Zone, but there were rumours that it was fantastic. As you would expect, greedy was our Vintar, like a vacuum cleaner for loot. He always went alone even in dangerous places so as not to share profits with assistants and he never bought lock picks with him. Other stalkers disliked him for this, but also respected him.  Vintar knew that working hard was the key to success and he amassed all his loot on his own, neither danger nor hard work made him hesitate.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story6_2">
    <text>It's said that he once dragged an old Soviet safe found somewhere in a cellar to the Bar to saw it open. What was in the safe and even whether there was anything at all - things like that are better left unsaid, all we know is that the burden weighed around a hundred kilos. Many don't believe it, but they don't know Vintar. Or rather, didn't know. Where did he keep his money, you ask?  He kept in that same safe. He welded it to the metal floor of the Bar, put a lock with a code on the door, and every month would slip the bartender a handful of artifacts for the protection of his private "stash."</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story6_3">
    <text>A recurring joke at the Bar was that when it's time for Vintar to leave the Zone taking all his loot, he will give it to the fighters like Ostap Bender in "The Little Golden Calf." Our hero did not trust electronic money at all. Joke was Vintar never responded and in general kept to himself: he wasn't friends with anyone nor did he clash with anyone, trusting nobody. He was a quiet man, but had a reputation of being gloomy and reticent, prefering to act than to think. Outside of the Zone he would have been a successful businessman or a rich man, though who knows.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story6_4">
    <text>The next spring our hero was going on a new raid God knows where - you guessed it, as usual, he didn't share his plan with anyone. A day passed, then another, then a week, but Vintar did not return. Normally a Stalker raiding for loot takes only three, maybe four days.  The Zone is large, but you can walk all over it in a week, ignoring the anomalies and other things in it of course. But two more days passed, and Vintar did not return. I must tell you that at the Bar there was an unwritten law, or rather, a custom that if a Stalker perished in the Zone, his property was given to his next of kin.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story6_5">
    <text>And if there were none, it would go to a friend or partner. The barman had just began to discuss who should be given Vintar's property with the Stalkers when out of nowhere a Stalker appeared. He declared that Vintar and he were the best of friends since childhood and now the missing Vintar's property belonged to him. "He had no family, his parents died long ago," our new friend sighed, "and I was like a brother to him. I protected him and took care of him." As proof of his words he showed some fuzzy old photographs standing with Vintar during military service.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story6_6">
    <text>The most experienced among the Stalkers gathered for council and started to discuss the issue (this wasn't common, it was due to the sums of money involved - the accumulated value of Vintar's years of looting). Some of these Stalkers suggested finding out whether there were any living relatives of the victim and send part of the money to them, and then divide the rest amongst themselve for their costs, so to say. But the others believed Vintar's freshly baked friend and entrusted everything to him. So the safe with Vintar's goods passed to the new owner.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story6_7">
    <text>You may think, perhaps, that their decision was too quick or even naive, however note that the Stalkers on this council were not fools and the majority understood that even if outside the Zone huge sums money are a sign of success, here in the Zone it is more likely a problem. Gangsters, thuggish mercenaries, envious "friends" - the laws here are different. But let's return to our story. Having acquired the right to open the safe, Vintar's friend got straight to work.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story6_8">
    <text>The safe refused to open easily - the code for the lock was known only to the previous owner. Not really bothered, our new acquaintance first brought a Pudova sledgehammer and when it didn't help, a propane torch. Removing, finally, the metallic door centimeters of metal thick, the Stalker was stunned: the safe was empty. Someone who knew the code for the lock had got there first and taken its contents! Looking closer he saw a bundle. Reaching into the back of the ruined safe the Stalker took from it a thick notebook wrapped in foil.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story6_9">
    <text>He opened the notebook and saw some incomprehensible scribbles: squares, zigzags, squiggles, and figures - a sea of figures. Inscriptions and figures - that's all the loot Vintar as a legacy. However, as you may have guessed, that wasn't all he had left. The newfound "millionaire" also understood this, and showed the Barman and another Stalker the notebook for their opinion on the scribbles. "It's a code," realized the Barman, "the dead man left a cryptic map to where he hid his savings".</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story6_10">
    <text>A scientist who happened to be in the Bar disagreed with this, a Dr. Gorbovsky (he was involved in the study of a disease afflicting Stalkers in the Zone). "This is a mathematical formula," concluded the doctor, "but I can't tell you what it means, because it is not in my field. I am a biologist, you see." The Stalkers knew that Vintar's money could not have disappeared and that the question of where it was hidden was probably answered by the formulas in the notebook. There being no mathematicians among the Stalkers, this question had no answer.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story6_11">
    <text>It's long been a habit in the Bar to discuss this story with a pint of beer. One Stalker guess that Vintar was not really lost, and all this time the sly one had quietly sent money out of the Zone. The safe was used as a distraction and when the time came, Vintar had simply dropped out of the Zone and disappeared. Others claimed that he was actually an underground scientist or as we say here, a "nugget", that is to say a unique person. Having solved the mathematical riddle of the Zone's laws, he had deduced a method of determining the places where most artifacts would appear and used it to his own ends.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="cheb_story6_12">
    <text>A lot of guesses were made by the people that came to the Bar but no one ever saw Vintar or his money again. And the notebook still lies somewhere under a counter at the Barman's. If you're in the area and drop by the "100Rads" Bar, you can ask to see it - it's free. And if you are well versed in mathematics, you have a chance at finding a key to the solution of this affair. For now it remains a mystery.</text>
